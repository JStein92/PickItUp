# PickItUp (WIP Title)

https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/17e9c023-444e-4eed-8839-8598ff7a85ce/branches/master/badge

### Summary

PickItUp is an social forward app that encourages users to pick up trash in their local community.

### How it works

- Users sign up through the social media platform of their choice (FB, Twitter, etc)
- While they are outside, they can take pictures of trash they pick up via the app.
- The pictures are combined into a "story" - so users can take multiple pictures along their walk. For example, a story may consist of:
    - Some trash on the ground
    - The trash in a bag
    - The user throwing away the trash
- The user enters how much trash they picked up, and may share their story to the app, as well as social media.
- The app is always tracking location, so the story is pushed to their local community shared story.
- Each community (possibly divided by town, or city) has a shared story, which consists of posts by users, stats for trash picked up, and a map of trash picked up.
- Users can interact with each others stories via comments and "likes"

### Additional features possible

- Leaderboards
- A way to organize groups for trash pickup events
- Sponsered pickup events by companies (see Pirika app)
- A global map
- Achievements (daily, weekly, lifetime)

### Stack
- React Native
- API TBD

### Platforms
- Android
- iPhone

### Funding possibilities 
- Ads
- Premium upgrade to remove ads
- Donate directly
- Buy awards (think Reddit gold, silver) to give to other people
- Coporate sponserships
